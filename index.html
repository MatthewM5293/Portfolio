            </header>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Matthew Munoz-Ramirez, an innovative and detail-oriented Software Developer with hands-on
                    experience designing, testing, and deploying software solutions. Proficient in Python, C#, and SQL,
                    I specialize in API development, test automation, and agile practices. My passion lies in leveraging
                    technical skills and creative problem-solving to deliver impactful software solutions that
                    streamline workflows and optimize functionality.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Neumont College of Computer Science
                    on August 30, 2024, achieving an exceptional GPA of 3.96. Demonstrating strong time management and
                    dedication, I completed my degree in just three years instead of the traditional four. During this
                    time, I gained proficiency in various programming languages and technologies, including Java, C++,
                    C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL, Flutter, Firebase, REST APIs, GitHub, JSON, and UI/UX design.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I held multiple leadership and collaborative roles, which honed my
                    leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills. I served as a Team Lead on projects, an
                    Academic Coach, a Student Associate, a Student Ambassador, and a representative in the Unified
                    Student Government (USG). These experiences not only enhanced my technical abilities but also fueled
                    my enthusiasm for working collaboratively and exploring new technologies.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about tackling complex challenges and crafting efficient software solutions that make
                    a difference. With a strong foundation in technology and a dedication to continuous learning, I
                    strive to bring creativity, precision, and impact to every project I undertake.</p>
